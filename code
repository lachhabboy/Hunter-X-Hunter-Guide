		"description": "Hunter x Hunter is a fantastic anime hidden under cover of a typical Shonen. On the surface, it has characters and their motivations following the Shonen archetype, but as we progress through the show, we encounter the darker sides of the anime.It is one of those series, which starts off light and cheery, and as you get deeper, the story takes a turn, and you’re blown away by how dark everything suddenly got.Another great thing about Hunter x Hunter is how it incorporates the light-hearted and cynical elements throughout the anime. It provides a perfect balance between them and keeps the viewers on their toes in each arc.",

		"name": "Which version to watch?",
		"description": "Hunter x Hunter has two anime adaptations. One was released in 1999, and the other in 2011. There are 92 episodes (including the OVAs) in the 1999 adaptation, while there are 148 episodes in the 2011 adaptation. It is generally recommended to watch the latter version, i.e., the 2011 adaption as it has better animation, almost no fillers, and has two additional arcs, one of which is considered to be the best arc there is. However, it is also true that the 1999 adaptation has much better incorporation of the first 2 arcs. The 2011 version might seem childish to many viewers, but that depends on your preference. The older version fillers are very entertaining and the overall anime has a more serious tone than the newer version.If you want to enjoy a longer story, and love digital graphics more than the hand-drawn ones, watch the complete 2011 version.",

On his journey, he becomes good friends with Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika, all with varying intentions of becoming a hunter.

The 1999 anime stops at the Yorknew City Arc, also called the Phantom Troupe Arc. This arc focuses on Kurapika’s involvement in the Mafia as he tries to retrieve the Scarlet Eyes, which initially belonged to his clan.

Unfortunately, the original anime doesn’t finish the arc. However, you’ll be able to watch the continuation of this arc in the first OVA releases of Hunter x Hunter.

Compared to the 2011 remake, the original series had a couple of fillers thrown into the adaptation. However, fans of the series have voiced that they appreciate the added bits of fun to lighten the mood. ",
